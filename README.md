# USB-Octomod

The USB-Octomod is a USB device which allows generation of computer-controlled analog synthesizer control voltages
in the range of approximately +/- 5V.
Using a small open-source and cross-platform host application, the user is able to control the 8 output channels
of the Octomod through a simple OSC/MIDI interface. 
The OSC interface allows composers, musicians, etc. to control the Octomod from their software environment of choice.
